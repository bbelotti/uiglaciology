# Creating a supportive and inclusive environment
Our group strives to be a welcoming and inclusive community in which you, and I, and all of us feel supported and included in our efforts to be the best scientists we can be.  We work hard and acknowledge that research and graduate school is difficult in their own rights. Therefore, we strive to support each other and take care of ourselves.  We do not accept any bullying or discrimination based on sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, religion, age, disability, or other intrinsic or cultural elements.

We acknowledge that our group members come from different backgrounds, with different experiences, and we value the breadth of perspectives that each member brings to our group.

Therefore, we welcome members from all different backgrounds.
