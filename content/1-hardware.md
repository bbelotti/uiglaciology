# Use of Hardware
We make a distinction between the server, kennicott, which is a powerful computer in the basement of McClure, to which everyone in the group can log in, and also local computers, which might be a desktop or laptop.

An important concept is that different computers, like kennicott, can be operated from a different computer.

kennicott can be accessed via a terminal and ssh (including with putty, from a Windows machine), or, alternately it can be mounted via samba to a local computer filesystem. U

We do most computing on the group server kennicott where we can access each other's scripts and access group datasets.
