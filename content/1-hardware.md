# Use of Hardware
We make a distinction between the server, kennicott, which is a powerful computer in the basement of McClure, to which everyone in the group can log in, and also local computers, which might be a desktop or laptop.

An important concept is that different computers, like kennicott, can be operated from a different computer.  

kennicott can be accessed via a terminal and ssh.  
* From a Windows machine, you'll want to use [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) (download and install the latest 64-bit MSI).  You'll also want to install and have running [XMing](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/).

Alternately, kennicott can be mounted via samba to any local computer filesystem.  Then, files can be transferred to and from kennicott's directories as though it were a local hard drive. Talk to Tim about any of the options, or for more information.

We do most computing on the group server kennicott where we can access each other's scripts and access group datasets.  See  the ['Structure'](https://tbartholomaus.github.io/uiglaciology/2-structure/) page on this site for more information and suggestions.
